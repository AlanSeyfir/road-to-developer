# road-to-developer
Ok with this repo I will upload every day and upload a video in my channel to forced myself to learn new things. Why? 

##Long story short I'm in a job (I don't know if I can say the company) and we're in the capacitation/bootcamp. 

Bc we're trainees they're give some languages and we need to learn them. In my previous repos I was doing some Java and now I'm with SQL. 
Although I fail the interview with java concepts (OOP, abstract, exception, etc) pretty simple BUT fake till to you make it and PRACTICE.

See it like 30daysofcode or 100days. But for me I want it to be until my semester ends (Dec 11). However it can be pretty tiredsome so I will make every month a recap or something
I don't that just came out of my mind right now.
