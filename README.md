### Ok now officially I will start the 100 days of code (although I started at 30 of Aug 2021) but anyways here is what I want to learn in this challenge.
This is my wishlist to understand at full but let's be real it's difficult. Also I want to apply to the typical FANGish companies.
* Frontend
  *HTML,CSS
  * Javascript
  * React
  * SASS
* Backend
  * Next
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB
* Git and Bash
* SEO, Webpack and NPM/Yarn
* Wordpress (for freelancing to obtain money yea)
* Leetcode Questions
* Learn Python

# Road to Java, SQL, HTML,CSS,JS (maybe minecraft modder or plugins or fullstack) developer. Later React Yeah
Ok with this repo I will upload every day and upload a video in my channel to forced myself to learn new things. Why? 

## Long story short I'm in a job (I don't know if I can say the company) and we're in the capacitation/bootcamp. 

Bc we're trainees they're give some languages and we need to learn them. In my previous repos I was doing some Java and now I'm with SQL. 
Although I fail the interview with java concepts (OOP, abstract, exception, etc) pretty simple BUT fake till to you make it and PRACTICE.

See it like 30daysofcode or 100days. But for me I want it to be until my semester ends (Dec 11). However it can be pretty tiredsome so I will make every month a recap or something
I don't that just came out of my mind right now.

Ok, so I'm starting to learn spring to code frontend and backend bc I can't think an exercise for java. That's why I found spring mix web dev and j a v a.

I'm changing bewteen Java and Javascript bc I prefer Frontend and JS is fun than Java lmao. (Although I learn JS BUT I need to do the courses in fresco play, it's a good platform ngl)
